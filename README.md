# Note Taker

This is an app that allows the user to write, store, and delete notes. I created the backend of this app using express.js and it is deployed to heroku at:
https://copious-note-taker.herokuapp.com/notes

## Usage

To use the app, click the "Get Started" button on the landing page. Then enter a title and some text for your note. Then click the save icon in the upper right corner to save your note in the database. You can then see your note in the lefthand column where you can bring it up again by clicking it. You can also delete your notes by clicking the red delete icon.
